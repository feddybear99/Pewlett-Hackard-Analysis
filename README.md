# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**Overview of the analysis:**

HP is preparing soon-to-be eligible retirees for their near future with these statements : 

*#1* Offering retirement package for soon-to-be eligible retirees who meet certain criteria
*#2* Starting to think about which positions need to be filled in the near future once employees do retire

**My task is to help Bobby @ HP (HR Analyst) answer these two questions:**

*How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?*

*Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?*


**Results**

The analysis touched upon four major points:

1. retirement titles - this list collected all employee title history (revealed promotion hierarchy)

2. unique_titles - this list is gathering the most recent and up-to-date employee information with duplicates removed:

3. retiring_titles - this list shows the titles that soon-to-be retiring employees have, which helps show the # of titles from each category that need to be filled (soon).

4. mentorship_eligibilty - this (snapshot) list shows a few current employees born between 1/1/1965 and 12/31/1965 that are now eligible to participate in the company's mentorship program

**Summary:** 

Looking at #3 written in the "Results" section, it seems that that would help answer the question, "How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?", in a categorized way. What might be more helpful is to categorize each title into different tier rankings that would give a greater breakdown to their recruiting department to emphasize the skill level that's needed in order to fill these positions once they're available.  

To answer the following question, "Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?", I wouldn't structure training courses with soon-to-be retirees. In my opinion, I think the mid-level employees that hold those titles should do the training so that there's less of a gap in transitioning job duties. Sometimes HR sends out a "employee buyout" package for eligible soon-to-be retirees, and if the eligible employees select the buyout plan, then there's less time on the calendar to utilize their time and designate it to training efforts.
